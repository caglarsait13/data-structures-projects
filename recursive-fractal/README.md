""" In these Project, I implemented the generateFractal recursive function. It generates a fractal made by cubes. Cubes were created with mesh triangles. There is also an example image taken from CloudCompare. Source code can be found in src folder. You can use make clear command to clear bin folder, make build command to compile source code and obtain object and finally, with make run command you can execute the object."""
